## WIP: Sauron-native
a rust UI library that conquers all platforms ranging from desktop to mobile devices.
An attempt to create a truly native, truly cross platform UI for your rust applications.

One UI to rule them all

Sauron native extends the [sauron](https://github.com/ivanceras/sauron) web framework
which is heavily inspired by [The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).
Sauron native can target multiple GUI backends.

## Currently supported backend
- gtk
- html
- tui
